# Library-Management-System
I have created a gui based library management system using tkinter which stores data with the help sqlite3.
This repository contain a frontend file designed using tkinter.
Also contaion a backend file which includes sql commands to store the data and changes entered by the user.
It can create a database file itself in the system.
This requires a python compiler to run upon.
